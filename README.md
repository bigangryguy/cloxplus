# cloxplus
A C++ implementation of the Lox programming language. This is an interpretation 
of the C implementation of clox in Section III of Bob Nystrom's site 
[Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).

As the project grows, a standard library and new language features will be
added. Expect this implementation to deviate from the original Lox specification
 in the future.

## Getting Started
Download the code. It uses C++20 and CMake. For a better understanding of the 
basic Lox language, read the [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) site.
In particular, read [Appendix I: Lox Grammar](https://craftinginterpreters.com/appendix-i.html).

## Contributing
As with most of my projects, just fork it.
